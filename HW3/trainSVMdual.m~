function svmModel = trainSVMdual(traindata, trainlabels, C)

%returns svmModel, whcih is a struct with 2 fields:
%svmModel.w and svmModel.w0

%we need to use qpac to solve the quadratic program; it's structure is:
%[x,err,lm] = qp(H,f,L,k,A,b,l,u,display);

%therefore, we need to create the vectors and matrices found from the 
%homework:

[m, n] = size(traindata); 

f = -ones(m,1);

H = (trainlabels*trainlabels.').*(traindata*traindata.');

A = trainlabels.';

b = 0;

ub 

lb = [ones(1,n)*-inf zeros(1,m) -inf].';

z = quadprog(H, f, A, b, [], [], lb, []);

svmModel.w0 = z(end);
svmModel.w = z(1:n);
